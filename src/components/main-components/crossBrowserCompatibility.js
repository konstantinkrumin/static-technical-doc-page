        Flexbox support is available in most new browsers â€” Firefox, Chrome,
        Opera, Microsoft Edge and IE 11, newer versions of Android/iOS, etc.
        However you should be aware that there are still older browsers in use
        that don't support Flexbox (or do, but support a really old, out-of-date
        version of it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        While you are just learning and experimenting, this doesn't matter too
        much; however if you are considering using flexbox in a real website you
        need to do testing and make sure that your user experience is still
        acceptable in as many browsers as possible.

        Flexbox is a bit trickier than some CSS features. For example, if a
        browser is missing a CSS drop shadow, then the site will likely still be
        usable. Not supporting flexbox features however will probably break a
        layout completely, making it unusable.
